It enhances the dining experience at Cornell with features such as providing the crowdedness of eateries, checking meal swipes and dining money balances, and favoriting dishes. Eatery is available on both iOS and Android platforms. Download the current release on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eatery-cornell-dining/id1089672962)!
