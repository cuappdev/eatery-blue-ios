Eatery was the first app released by AppDev.  With over 6,000 students using it every month, it enables students to browse menus and discover places to eat on Cornellâ€™s campus and in Collegetown. It enhances the dining experience at Cornell with features such as providing the crowdedness of eateries, checking meal swipes and dining money balances, and favoriting dishes. Eatery is available on both [iOS](https://github.com/cuappdev/eatery-blue-ios) and Android platforms.
